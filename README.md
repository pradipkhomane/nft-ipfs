# LW3Punks NFT Project

This project is an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) collection called LW3Punks deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. LW3Punks are unique digital collectibles that you can own and trade. Each LW3Punk is represented by a unique token on the blockchain.

## Contract Details

The LW3Punks contract is implemented in Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. Below are some key details about the contract:

- **Name:** LW3Punks
- **Symbol:** LW3P
- **Contract Address:** [Contract Address Here]
- **Compiler Version:** Solidity ^0.8.25

The contract inherits from ERC721Enumerable and Ownable contracts from the OpenZeppelin library, providing standard ERC721 functionality and ownership control.

## Features

- **Minting:** Users can mint LW3Punks by sending the required amount of Ether to the contract. Each minted LW3Punk is assigned a unique token ID.
- **Pausing:** The contract can be paused or unpaused by the contract owner. When paused, minting functionality is disabled.
- **Withdrawal:** The contract owner can withdraw accumulated Ether from the contract to their address.

## Usage

To use LW3Punks:

1. Connect your Ethereum wallet to a supported Web3 browser or wallet application.
2. Navigate to the LW3Punks contract address.
3. Use the provided functions to mint LW3Punks, manage contract pausing, and withdraw Ether.
